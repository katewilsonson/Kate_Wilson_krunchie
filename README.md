## Concept and Aesthetic

Initially, my software concept was an audio application that contained reverb, pitch, distortion and volume controls. I had also planned to have the sliders controlling these parameters to also be RGB sliders, controlling a colour picker box so you could set colour and sound preferences at the same time. However, upon further development I decided to make an audio plugin that just dealt with distortion. It still has four sliders; drive, range, mix and gain, with each slider being a different colour. I couldn't get the RGB sliders to work with a colour picker but I still liked the idea of using colour as a way of setting sounds style. This is also why I chose to add text labels to the sliders, so the colour of each slider is the only thing that sets them aparty visually. 

## Motivation

The motivation behind this plugin was really just to make something that I would actually use in my own music. I play a lot of electric guitar and bass, and am always applying distortion. I thought it would be cool if I could use a plugin that I made in my own music.


## Related Works

I looked at a lot of other distortion plugins to get some inspiration for mine. I looked at 'Decapitator' by Soundtoys, it has six knobs; drive, low cut, high cut, tone, mix and output. I also looked at Sonimus Burnley 73, which also has six knobs; an HP filter, gain, output and a 3 band EQ. Another plugin I looked at was one of the free Logic Pro X plugins called 'Distortion II', it has three knobs; pregain, drive and tone. All of these plugins used rotary sliders or knobs, as most analogue distortion units have knobs. They also all had pretty minimal controls which is something I was going for with mine as I wanted to kind of stick to my original idea of having RGB sliders so I kept mine to 4 sliders.
